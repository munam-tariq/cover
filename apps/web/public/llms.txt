# SupportBase

> SupportBase is an AI chatbot platform built for developers using AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf. It enables adding customer support chatbots to any website with a single line of code. The platform features MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, allowing developers to manage chatbots entirely from within their AI editor without context switching.

SupportBase lets you create AI chatbots that answer customer questions using your knowledge base (PDFs, text, URLs). Key differentiators:

- **MCP-First**: Manage everything via AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf) without leaving your editor
- **One-Line Install**: Single `<script>` tag embeds the chat widget on any website
- **15-Minute Setup**: From zero to live chatbot in minutes
- **RAG-Powered**: Semantic chunking, contextual embeddings, and hybrid search for accurate answers
- **Lead Capture**: Automatically collects emails when the bot can't answer
