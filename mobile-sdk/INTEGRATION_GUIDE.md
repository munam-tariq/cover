# FrontFace Mobile SDK — Integration Guide

> Build a native chat support experience (AI assistant + live human handoff) for your
> Flutter app on top of the FrontFace public API.

**Audience:** the Flutter developer building the SDK.
**Base URL:** `https://api.frontface.app`
**Transport:** HTTPS + JSON for requests/responses; a WebSocket (Supabase Realtime) for live
human-handoff streaming, with an HTTP polling fallback.

---

## 1. How it works (architecture)

FrontFace is a **server-mediated** chat platform. Your app never talks to a database or an LLM
directly — it makes plain HTTPS calls to the public API, and the server handles RAG, the LLM,
lead storage, and routing to human agents. The web chat widget and the hosted public page are
both thin clients over the exact same endpoints you'll use; this SDK is simply a third client.

```
┌────────────┐   HTTPS (JSON)        ┌──────────────────┐
│ Flutter app│ ───────────────────▶  │  api.frontface.app│ ── LLM / RAG / agents / DB
│  (this SDK)│ ◀───────────────────  │   (public API)    │
└─────┬──────┘   responses           └─────────┬────────┘
      │                                         │ server broadcasts agent replies
      │  Supabase Realtime (WebSocket)          │
      └────────────────◀───────────────────────┘
         channel "conversation:<id>"  (live human-handoff only)
```

Two interaction modes:

1. **AI chat (always):** synchronous request/response. `POST /api/chat/message` returns the
   assistant's reply in the HTTP response. No socket needed.
2. **Live human handoff (when the visitor asks for a human):** the conversation is routed to a
   human agent. Agent replies arrive **asynchronously**, so you subscribe to a Realtime channel
   (or poll) to receive them. This is the only part that needs the WebSocket.

---

## 2. Authentication & identity

Every request carries three things: a **publishable key**, a **visitor id**, and (for chat) a
**source**.

### 2.1 Publishable client key — `X-FrontFace-Key`

Each app gets a **publishable client key** that looks like `pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
Send it on **every** request:

```
X-FrontFace-Key: pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- It is **publishable, not a secret.** It is safe to ship inside your app binary (same model as a
  Stripe publishable key, a Google Maps API key, or a Supabase anon key). Do not treat it like a
  password, but also don't go out of your way to leak it.
- It is **scoped to one project** and **revocable**. If a key is ever abused, the project owner
  revokes it in the dashboard and ships a new app build — the old key stops working within ~5
  minutes, and **the project's web widget is unaffected**.
- You will be handed a **test key + the matching `projectId`** to start development (see README).

> **Why a key at all?** Mobile apps send no browser `Origin` header, which the chat endpoint
> normally requires. The key is what authorizes your app instead. It also gives the project owner
> a per-app kill switch and clean analytics.

### 2.2 Visitor id — `X-Visitor-Id`

You generate a **stable, per-install** visitor id once, persist it, and reuse it forever. It
identifies the device/user to the backend across conversations (history, lead linkage, rate
limiting).

- **Format:** any opaque string ≤ 100 chars. Recommended: a UUID v4, or `mob_<uuid>`.
- **Persistence:** store in secure/persistent device storage (e.g. `flutter_secure_storage` or
  `shared_preferences`). Generate it on first launch; never regenerate it on reinstall-survival
  unless you intend a "fresh" identity.
- Send it both as the `X-Visitor-Id` header **and** in the request body field `visitorId` where
  the endpoint takes one (the backend reads both).

### 2.3 Source

Chat/lead/conversation requests take a `source` field. **Always send `"mobile"`.** This segments
your traffic in the dashboard's analytics and inbox.

### 2.4 Standard headers (every request)

| Header | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | on POST |
| `X-FrontFace-Key` | `pk_…` | required on all requests |
| `X-Visitor-Id` | your stable visitor id | also mirror into the body `visitorId` |

---

## 3. Core concepts & lifecycle

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| `projectId` | The FrontFace project (agent) you're embedding. Provided to you with the key. |
| `visitorId` | Stable per-install id (§2.2). |
| `sessionId` | The **conversation id** (a UUID). `sessionId` and "conversation id" are the same value. |
| `source` | Always `"mobile"`. |

**Session lifecycle**

1. **First message:** call `POST /api/chat/message` with **no** `sessionId`. The response returns a
   `sessionId` — persist it (per project). That is now the active conversation.
2. **Subsequent messages:** send the stored `sessionId` so the thread continues.
3. **Resume after app restart:** reload the stored `sessionId` and rehydrate the thread with
   `GET /api/widget/conversations/<sessionId>/messages/public` (full history when called without
   `?after=`).
4. **"New chat":** drop the stored `sessionId` (and optionally call the close endpoint, §8) so the
   next message starts a fresh conversation.

> Reuse a stored session only while it is still AI-owned (`status == "ai_active"`) or in handoff.
> A `resolved`/`closed` conversation should not accept new visitor messages — start a new chat.

---

## 4. Bootstrap — fetch runtime config

Call this once on launch (and cache it). It returns branding, lead-capture configuration, and the
**Realtime credentials** you need for live handoff.

```
GET /api/embed/config/{projectId}
Headers: X-FrontFace-Key, X-Visitor-Id
```

**Response (200):**

```jsonc
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "enabled": true,
  "config": {
    "primaryColor": "#0a0a0a",
    "position": "bottom-right",     // web-only; ignore on mobile
    "greeting": "Hi! How can I help you today?",
    "greetingIntro": "Hi there!",
    "title": "Chat with us",
    "placeholder": "Type a message..."
  },
  "realtime": {
    "supabaseUrl": "https://<ref>.supabase.co",
    "supabaseAnonKey": "eyJ...   (public anon key — safe to use client-side)"
  },
  "leadCapture": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formFields": {
      "email":   { "required": true },
      "field_2": { "enabled": true, "label": "Company", "required": false },
      "field_3": { "enabled": false, "label": "", "required": false }
    },
    "hasQualifyingQuestions": true,
    "capture_mode": "email_after"   // "email_after" | "email_first" | "email_required"
  },
  "voice": { "enabled": false }      // voice is out of scope for v1
}
```

Use `config.greeting` for the opening assistant bubble, `config.primaryColor`/`title` for theming,
`leadCapture` to drive the form (§7), and `realtime.*` to connect the handoff socket (§6).

> `proactiveEngagement` and `leadRecovery` blocks may also appear — ignore them for v1.

---

## 5. AI chat

```
POST /api/chat/message
Headers: Content-Type, X-FrontFace-Key, X-Visitor-Id
```

**Request body:**

```jsonc
{
  "projectId": "uuid",            // required
  "message": "How do I reset my password?", // required, max 2000 chars
  "visitorId": "mob_…",           // required (mirror of the header)
  "source": "mobile",             // always "mobile"
  "sessionId": "uuid-or-null",    // omit/null for the first message; send to continue
  "conversationHistory": [        // optional; last ~10 turns for context
    { "role": "user", "content": "…" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "…" }
  ],
  "context": {                    // optional analytics metadata
    "device": "mobile",
    "os": "iOS",
    "osVersion": "17.5",
    "timezone": "Europe/London",
    "language": "en-GB",
    "appVersion": "1.2.0"
  }
}
```

**Response (200):**

```jsonc
{
  "response": "To reset your password…",   // assistant reply (may be "" — see handoff note)
  "sessionId": "uuid",                       // persist this
  "sources": [ { "id": "…", "name": "…", "relevance": 0.8 } ],
  "toolCalls": [ { "name": "…", "success": true, "duration": 123 } ],
  "processingTime": 842,
  "requestId": "…",                          // include in bug reports
  "handoff": {                               // present only when relevant — see §6.3
    "triggered": false,
    "reason": "agent_handling",
    "queuePosition": 2
  }
}
```

**Errors** (shape `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }`):

| Status | code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `INVALID_INPUT` / `MESSAGE_TOO_LONG` / `EMPTY_MESSAGE` | Bad body / message > 2000 chars |
| 403 | `MISSING_ORIGIN` / `DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED` | Key missing/invalid (see §9) |
| 404 | `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | Bad `projectId` |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` | Throttled — honor `Retry-After` (§9) |
| 504 | `TIMEOUT` | Upstream LLM timeout — safe to retry once |

Render `response` as the assistant bubble. If `response` is empty, inspect `handoff` (§6.3).

---

## 6. Live human handoff

When a visitor wants a person — or the AI decides to escalate — the conversation moves to a human
agent. Agent messages then arrive **asynchronously** over Realtime (or polling).

### 6.1 Status state machine

```
ai_active ──(handoff)──▶ waiting ──(agent claims)──▶ agent_active ──(ends)──▶ resolved | closed
     ▲                                                                            │
     └──────────────────── "New chat" / reopened ───────────────────────────────┘
```

| Status | Meaning | UI |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_active` | Talking to the AI | normal chat input |
| `waiting` | Queued for a human | show "waiting for an agent", `queuePosition` |
| `agent_active` | A human agent is handling it | show agent name, enable typing indicators |
| `resolved` / `closed` | Conversation ended | show "conversation ended", offer New chat |

"In handoff" = status is `waiting` **or** `agent_active`.

### 6.2 Triggering handoff (the "Talk to a human" button)

You need a conversation id first. If the visitor hasn't sent a message yet, create one:

```
POST /api/chat/ensure-conversation
Body: { "projectId", "visitorId", "source": "mobile" }
→ 200 { "conversationId": "uuid" }    // persist as sessionId
```

Then check availability and trigger:

```
GET  /api/projects/{projectId}/handoff-availability
→ 200 { "available": true, "showButton": true, "buttonText": "Talk to a human",
        "showOfflineForm": false, "reason": "…" }

POST /api/conversations/{conversationId}/handoff
Body: { "reason": "button_click" }    // or "customer_request"
→ 200 {
        "status": "agent_active" | "waiting" | "offline",
        "queuePosition": 3,                 // when waiting
        "estimatedWaitMinutes": 6,          // when waiting
        "assignedAgent": { "id": "…", "name": "Sara" },  // when agent_active
        "message": "Our team is offline…",  // when offline
        "showOfflineForm": true             // when offline
      }
```

- `available:false` / `showButton:false` → don't show the button (handoff disabled, no agents, or
  outside business hours; see `reason`).
- `status:"offline"` or `showOfflineForm:true` → show an offline form and submit it via the
  offline-message endpoint (your AI agent's owner configures this; out of core v1 scope but
  available at `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/offline-messages`).
- Otherwise enter the handoff UI and start streaming (§6.4).

### 6.3 Detecting handoff from a chat response

A normal `POST /api/chat/message` can also signal handoff (e.g. the visitor typed "I want a
human", or the thread is already owned by an agent). Use this predicate (mirrors the web client):

```
enterHandoff =
  handoff.triggered == true
  OR (response is empty AND handoff.reason in {"in_queue", "agent_handling"})

target status = (handoff.reason == "agent_handling") ? "agent_active" : "waiting"
```

When already in handoff, the AI no longer answers, so `response` comes back empty and `handoff`
carries the current state.

### 6.4 Receiving agent messages — Realtime (primary)

Connect to Supabase Realtime using the `realtime` creds from the bootstrap config (§4) and
subscribe to a per-conversation **broadcast** channel.

- **Channel name:** `conversation:<conversationId>`
- **Connection:** Supabase Realtime endpoint `wss://<ref>.supabase.co/realtime/v1` with
  `apikey = realtime.supabaseAnonKey`. The Dart package `supabase_flutter` (or `realtime_client`)
  handles this — see §12.
- **Channel config:** `broadcast: { self: false }`.
- **Subscribe only while in handoff** (`waiting`/`agent_active`); unsubscribe when you leave it.

**Events** (all are `broadcast`; the useful payload is nested at `payload['payload']['data']`):

| Event | `data` shape | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `message:new` | `{ message: { id, senderType, senderId?, senderName?, content, createdAt, metadata? } }` | Append the message. `senderType` ∈ `customer\|agent\|ai\|system`. Skip `customer` (your own echo). De-dupe by `id`. |
| `conversation:status_changed` | `{ conversationId, status, queuePosition? }` | Apply status transition; update queue position. |
| `conversation:assigned` | `{ agentId, agent: { name } }` | Set agent name; status → `agent_active`. |
| `queue:position_updated` | `{ position }` | Update queue position. |
| `conversation:resolved` | `{ conversationId, resolution }` | If `resolution=="ai_active"` go back to AI, else treat as `resolved`/ended. |
| `typing:start` / `typing:stop` | `{ participant: { type, name? } }` | If `participant.type=="agent"`, show/hide the agent typing indicator. |

**Reconnect:** exponential backoff `min(1000 * 2^attempts, 30000)` ms, up to 5 attempts; after
that, fall back to polling (§6.5). On subscribe-status `SUBSCRIBED` you're live; `CLOSED` /
`CHANNEL_ERROR` means dropped.

### 6.5 Receiving agent messages — polling (fallback)

If Realtime can't connect (or as a deliberate simpler v1), poll while in handoff:

```
GET /api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/public?after={lastCreatedAtISO}
→ 200 { "messages": [ { id, senderType, senderName?, content, createdAt } ] }
```

- Poll every **2 s**. Track the newest `createdAt` you've seen and pass it as `?after=` so you only
  fetch new messages. Without `?after=` you get the full history (use that for rehydration on
  resume).
- Every ~5th poll (~10 s), also call status to catch queue/agent/resolution changes:

```
GET /api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/status
→ 200 { "id", "status", "assignedAgent": { "id", "name" }?, "queuePosition"? }
```

When Realtime reconnects, stop polling (and vice-versa) — never run both.

### 6.6 Typing & presence (optional, only during `agent_active`)

```
POST /api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/typing
Body: { "isTyping": true, "participantType": "customer" }
// debounce: send isTyping:true on keystroke, isTyping:false ~1200ms after the last keystroke

POST /api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/presence
Body: { "status": "online" | "idle" | "offline", "visitorId": "mob_…" }
// send "online" on entering handoff, then a heartbeat every 30s; "offline" when backgrounding
```

Both are best-effort (ignore failures).

---

## 7. Lead capture

Some projects collect a lead (email + optional fields), optionally followed by a qualifying
question. The shape is driven by the `leadCapture` block from bootstrap (§4).

**`capture_mode`:**
- `email_after` — show the form after the first AI exchange.
- `email_first` / `email_required` — show the form before chatting.

**Skip if already done** (cache locally; the backend also tracks it):

```
GET /api/chat/lead-capture/status?projectId={projectId}&visitorId={visitorId}
→ 200 { "hasCompletedForm": true }
```

**Submit the form:**

```
POST /api/chat/lead-capture/submit-form
Body: {
  "projectId", "visitorId",
  "sessionId": "uuid-or-null",
  "source": "mobile",
  "formData": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "field_2": { "label": "Company", "value": "Acme" },   // include only enabled fields
    "field_3": { "label": "…", "value": "…" }
  },
  "firstMessage": "the visitor's first message, or \"\""
}
→ 200 {
  "success": true,
  "leadId": "uuid",
  "nextAction": "qualifying_question" | "none",
  "qualifyingQuestion": "What are you trying to build?",   // when nextAction == qualifying_question
  "assembledGreeting": "Hi there!\n…\nWhat are you trying to build?",  // render this as the next assistant bubble
  "sessionId": "uuid-or-null"   // a fresh conversation id may be returned (email_first) — persist it
}
```

- Validate email client-side; a bad email returns `400 INVALID_EMAIL`.
- If `nextAction == "qualifying_question"`, show `assembledGreeting` as the assistant's next
  message and let the visitor answer in chat as normal.
- If the response returns a `sessionId`, persist it (it may be newly created).

**Quick inline email** (lighter variant, optional):

```
POST /api/chat/lead-capture/submit-inline
Body: { "projectId", "visitorId", "sessionId": "uuid-or-null", "email": "…", "captureSource": "inline_email" }
```

---

## 8. Customer identify (optional)

If your app already knows who the user is (they're logged in), link that identity to the visitor:

```
POST /api/customers/identify
Body: {
  "visitorId": "mob_…",          // required, ≤100 chars
  "projectId": "uuid",           // required
  "email": "user@example.com",   // required, valid email
  "name": "Jane Doe",            // optional, ≤100 chars
  "metadata": { "plan": "pro" }  // optional, arbitrary key/values
}
→ 200 { "customer": { "id", "email", "name", "metadata", … } }
```

Errors: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` (with `details`), `404 PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`.

---

## 9. Errors & rate limiting

**Error envelope** (all endpoints): `{ "error": { "code": "STRING", "message": "…", "details"?: {} } }`.

**Rate limiting:** on throttle you get **HTTP 429** with a `Retry-After: <seconds>` header and:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "RATE_LIMITED", "message": "Too many messages…", "retryAfter": 30 } }
```

Successful responses also include `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` (unix seconds).
**Always honor `Retry-After`** — back off and surface a gentle "you're sending messages too
quickly" state rather than hammering.

**A 403 on `/api/chat/message`** almost always means the `X-FrontFace-Key` is missing, malformed,
revoked, or doesn't match the `projectId` in the body. Verify the key/project pairing.

---

## 10. Client-side security guidelines

The SDK must treat **all server-provided strings as untrusted display data**:

- **Escape / never execute** server text. Project name, agent name, greetings, and message content
  originate from end users and tenants.
- **Markdown:** if you render assistant Markdown, use a renderer with a **URL scheme allow-list**
  (`https`, `http`, `mailto` only). Never allow `javascript:` (or other) schemes in links.
- **Never log the `X-FrontFace-Key`** to analytics/crash reporting.
- **Don't query Supabase tables directly.** The `supabaseAnonKey` is for **Realtime broadcast
  subscription only** — subscribe to `conversation:<id>` and nothing else. Don't attempt table
  reads/writes with it.
- Treat the conversation id as a capability: it's an unguessable UUID that grants access to that
  thread. Don't expose it in shareable links/logs.

---

## 11. Recommended Flutter packages

| Need | Package |
|---|---|
| HTTP | `dio` or `http` |
| Realtime (handoff) | `supabase_flutter` (use its `RealtimeClient`/`channel` API) or `realtime_client` |
| Stable id / persistence | `uuid` + `flutter_secure_storage` (or `shared_preferences`) |
| Device/context metadata | `device_info_plus`, `package_info_plus` (for the optional `context` block) |
| Markdown (allow-listed) | `flutter_markdown` with a custom/safe link handler |

A typed client + models can be generated from `openapi.yaml` (see README).

---

## 12. Realtime connection sketch (Dart)

```dart
// creds from GET /api/embed/config/{projectId}
final client = RealtimeClient(
  '${supabaseUrl}/realtime/v1',
  params: {'apikey': supabaseAnonKey},
);
client.connect();

final channel = client.channel(
  'conversation:$conversationId',
  RealtimeChannelConfig(self: false),
);

channel.onBroadcast(event: 'message:new', callback: (payload) {
  final msg = payload['payload']?['data']?['message'];
  if (msg != null && msg['senderType'] != 'customer') appendMessage(msg);
});
channel.onBroadcast(event: 'conversation:status_changed', callback: (p) {
  applyStatus(p['payload']?['data']);
});
channel.onBroadcast(event: 'conversation:assigned', callback: (p) {
  setAgent(p['payload']?['data']?['agent']?['name']);
});
// …queue:position_updated, conversation:resolved, typing:start, typing:stop

channel.subscribe((status, [err]) {
  if (status == 'SUBSCRIBED') stopPolling();
  if (status == 'CLOSED' || status == 'CHANNEL_ERROR') startPollingWithBackoff();
});
```

## 13. Quick reference — endpoints (v1 scope)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/embed/config/{projectId}` | Bootstrap: branding, lead-capture config, realtime creds |
| POST | `/api/chat/message` | Send a message, get the AI reply |
| POST | `/api/chat/ensure-conversation` | Create a conversation before the first message (for handoff) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{projectId}/handoff-availability` | Can the visitor reach a human now? |
| POST | `/api/conversations/{conversationId}/handoff` | Request a human |
| GET | `/api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/status` | Conversation status / queue / agent |
| GET | `/api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/public` | Poll messages (`?after=ISO`) / rehydrate |
| POST | `/api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/typing` | Customer typing indicator |
| POST | `/api/widget/conversations/{conversationId}/presence` | Customer presence heartbeat |
| GET | `/api/chat/lead-capture/status` | Has this visitor completed the lead form? |
| POST | `/api/chat/lead-capture/submit-form` | Submit the lead form |
| POST | `/api/chat/lead-capture/submit-inline` | Inline email-only capture |
| POST | `/api/customers/identify` | Link a known email/name to the visitor |

All require `X-FrontFace-Key` + `X-Visitor-Id`. Realtime channel: `conversation:<conversationId>`.

## 14. Open questions / out of scope for v1

Flagged for a later phase — **not** part of this contract:

- **Voice** (ElevenLabs) — disabled in v1.
- **Push notifications** for agent replies while the app is backgrounded (no server push contract
  yet; Realtime/polling only work in-foreground).
- **Attachments / images** in messages.
- **Offline message queue** and retry semantics beyond simple `Retry-After`.
- **Cross-device conversation history** (the recent-conversations list is currently web/public-page
  specific).
- **Theming** beyond `primaryColor`/`title`.

Raise these with the FrontFace team before building around them.
