# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 What We're Building

A simple, easy-to-integrate AI chatbot platform for small businesses that offers:

1. **Dashboard-based setup** - Business owners upload knowledge (text, files, PDFs) and configure API endpoints through a clean, modern dashboard
2. **MCP Integration** - AI development platforms (Lovable, Bolt.new, Cursor, Claude Code) can programmatically set up chatbots via Model Context Protocol
3. **One-line embed** - Single script tag to add chatbot to any website

## 1.2 Core Value Proposition

**For Small Businesses:** Get a working AI chatbot on your website in under 20 minutes. Upload your FAQs, connect your APIs, copy one script tag. Done.

**For Vibe Coders:** Add "a customer support chatbot" to your AI-generated website with a single prompt. The MCP handles everything.

## 1.3 Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **MCP-first architecture** | First chatbot built for AI development tools |
| **API tool calling** | Real-time data (order status, inventory) not just static FAQs |
| **True simplicity** | Competitors claim "simple" but still confuse users |
| **Script-tag embed** | Works anywhere, like Google Analytics |

# 2. Product Vision & Strategy

## 2.1 Vision Statement

Become the default chatbot for AI-generated websites while serving as the simplest chatbot solution for non-technical small business owners.

```

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Supabase magic link
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  email: userEmail,
  options: {
    emailRedirectTo: `${origin}/auth/callback`,
  },
});

// Auth callback handler (/auth/callback)
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

if (session) {
  // Check if user has a project
  const { data: project } = await supabase
    .from('projects')
    .select('id')
    .eq('user_id', session.user.id)
    .single();

  if (!project) {
    // Create default project for new user
    await supabase.from('projects').insert({
      user_id: session.user.id,
      name: 'My Chatbot',
    });
  }

  redirect('/dashboard');
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Invalid email format | Show inline validation error |
| Email not delivered | Show "Resend" option after 60 seconds |
| Expired magic link | Show "Link expired" with option to request new one |
| Already logged in user visits /login | Redirect to /dashboard |
| Rate limit exceeded | Show "Too many requests, try again later" |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can enter valid email and receive magic link

### Chunking Strategy

```typescript
interface ChunkingConfig {
  maxTokens: 500;           // Maximum tokens per chunk
  overlapTokens: 50;        // Overlap between chunks
  minChunkSize: 100;        // Minimum chunk size (avoid tiny chunks)
  preserveParagraphs: true; // Try to break at paragraph boundaries
  preserveSentences: true;  // Try to break at sentence boundaries
}
```

**Example:**
```
Original document: 2000 tokens
Chunk 1: tokens 0-500
Chunk 2: tokens 450-950 (50 token overlap)
Chunk 3: tokens 900-1400
Chunk 4: tokens 1350-1850
Chunk 5: tokens 1800-2000
```

### User Flow

```
1. User clicks "Add Knowledge" button
2. Modal opens with three tabs: "Paste Text" | "Upload File" | "Upload PDF"
3. User selects input method:

   [Paste Text]
   - User pastes content into textarea
   - User enters name for source
   - User clicks "Add Knowledge"

   [Upload File]
   - User clicks upload area or drags file
   - System validates file type (.txt)
   - User clicks "Add Knowledge"

   [Upload PDF]
   - User clicks upload area or drags file
   - System validates file type (.pdf)
   - User clicks "Add Knowledge"

4. Modal closes, source appears in list with "Processing..." status
5. Background job processes content
6. Status updates to "Ready" with chunk count
7. Knowledge is now available for chatbot queries
```

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// API endpoint: POST /api/knowledge
async function createKnowledgeSource(req: Request) {
  const { projectId, type, name, content, file } = req.body;

  // 1. Create knowledge source record
  const { data: source } = await supabase
    .from('knowledge_sources')
    .insert({
      project_id: projectId,
      type,
      name,
      status: 'processing',
    })
    .select()
    .single();

  // 2. If file, upload to Supabase Storage
  if (file) {
    const { data: fileData } = await supabase.storage
      .from('knowledge-files')
      .upload(`${projectId}/${source.id}/${file.name}`, file);

    await supabase
      .from('knowledge_sources')
      .update({ file_path: fileData.path })
      .eq('id', source.id);
  }

  // 3. Queue background job for processing
  await queue.add('process-knowledge', {
    sourceId: source.id,
    content: content || null,
    filePath: file ? fileData.path : null,
  });

  return { source };
}

// Background job: process-knowledge
async function processKnowledge(job) {
  const { sourceId, content, filePath } = job.data;

  try {
    // 1. Extract text
    let text = content;
    if (filePath) {
      const file = await supabase.storage
        .from('knowledge-files')
        .download(filePath);

      if (filePath.endsWith('.pdf')) {
        text = await extractPdfText(file);
      } else {
        text = await file.text();
      }
    }

    // 2. Chunk text
    const chunks = chunkText(text, {
      maxTokens: 500,
      overlapTokens: 50,
    });

    // 3. Generate embeddings (batch)
    const embeddings = await openai.embeddings.create({
      model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
      input: chunks.map(c => c.content),
    });

    // 4. Store chunks with embeddings
    const chunkRecords = chunks.map((chunk, i) => ({
      source_id: sourceId,
      content: chunk.content,
      embedding: embeddings.data[i].embedding,
      metadata: { position: i },
    }));

    await supabase.from('knowledge_chunks').insert(chunkRecords);

    // 5. Update source status
    await supabase
      .from('knowledge_sources')
      .update({
        status: 'ready',
        chunk_count: chunks.length,
      })
      .eq('id', sourceId);

  } catch (error) {
    await supabase
      .from('knowledge_sources')
      .update({ status: 'failed', error: error.message })
      .eq('id', sourceId);
  }
}
```

### File Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Max file size | 10 MB |
| Max text paste | 100,000 characters |
| Supported text files | .txt |
| Supported PDFs | .pdf (text-based, not scanned images) |
| Max sources per project (V1) | 20 |
| Max total chunks per project | 1,000 |

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Empty file | Show error "File is empty" |
| Corrupted PDF | Show error "Could not parse file" |
| Scanned PDF (no text) | Show error "PDF contains no extractable text" |
| File too large | Show error "File exceeds 10MB limit" |
| Processing fails | Show "Failed" status with retry option |
| Duplicate file name | Allow (append timestamp internally) |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can paste text and it becomes searchable knowledge
- [ ] User can upload .txt file and it becomes searchable knowledge
- [ ] User can upload .pdf file and it becomes searchable knowledge
- [ ] Processing happens asynchronously (UI doesn't block)
- [ ] User can see processing status in real-time
- [ ] User can delete knowledge source
- [ ] Deleting source removes all chunks and embeddings
- [ ] Chatbot can answer questions from uploaded knowledge

## 6.3 Feature: API Endpoint Configuration

### Overview
Users configure external APIs that the chatbot can call as "tools" to fetch real-time data. The LLM decides when to call these APIs based on user questions and endpoint descriptions.

### User Story
> As a business owner, I want to connect my order status API so customers can check their orders through the chatbot without contacting me.

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| API-1 | User can add new API endpoint | Must Have |
| API-2 | Endpoint config includes: name, description, URL, method | Must Have |
| API-3 | User can select auth type: None, API Key, Bearer Token | Must Have |
| API-4 | User can input auth credentials (stored encrypted) | Must Have |
| API-5 | User can test endpoint from dashboard | Must Have |
| API-6 | User can see list of all configured endpoints | Must Have |
| API-7 | User can edit existing endpoint | Must Have |
| API-8 | User can delete endpoint | Must Have |
| API-9 | LLM uses description to decide when to call endpoint | Must Have |
| API-10 | URL supports {placeholder} syntax for dynamic params | Must Have |
| API-11 | User can configure custom headers | Could Have |
| API-12 | User can configure request body template | Could Have |

### API Configuration Model

```typescript
interface ApiEndpoint {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  name: string;                    // "Order Status"
  description: string;             // "Get order status by order ID. Call when user asks about their order."
  url: string;                     // "https://api.store.com/orders/{order_id}"
  method: 'GET' | 'POST';
  authType: 'none' | 'api_key' | 'bearer' | 'custom_header';
  authConfig: {
    apiKey?: string;               // For api_key type
    apiKeyHeader?: string;         // Header name for API key (default: X-API-Key)
    bearerToken?: string;          // For bearer type
    customHeader?: {               // For custom_header type
      name: string;
      value: string;
    };
  };
  requestBody?: object;            // Template for POST requests
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Description Best Practices (Shown to User)

```
Good descriptions help the AI know WHEN to use your API:

✓ "Get order status and tracking information. Use when customer asks
   about their order, shipping status, or tracking number. Requires order_id."

✓ "Check product inventory and availability. Use when customer asks
   if an item is in stock or available. Requires product_id or product_name."

✗ "Order API" (too vague)
✗ "GET /orders" (doesn't explain when to use)
```

### User Flow

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// API endpoint: POST /api/endpoints
async function createEndpoint(req: Request) {
  const {
    projectId, name, description, url, method, authType, authConfig
  } = req.body;

  // Encrypt sensitive credentials
  const encryptedAuthConfig = await encrypt(authConfig);

  const { data: endpoint } = await supabase
    .from('api_endpoints')
    .insert({
      project_id: projectId,
      name,
      description,
      url,
      method,
      auth_type: authType,
      auth_config: encryptedAuthConfig,
    })
    .select()
    .single();

  return { endpoint };
}

// API endpoint: POST /api/endpoints/:id/test
async function testEndpoint(req: Request) {
  const { id } = req.params;

  const { data: endpoint } = await supabase
    .from('api_endpoints')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', id)
    .single();

  const authConfig = await decrypt(endpoint.auth_config);

  // Build test URL (replace placeholders with test values)
  const testUrl = endpoint.url.replace(/\{(\w+)\}/g, 'test_value');

  try {
    const response = await fetch(testUrl, {
      method: endpoint.method,
      headers: buildAuthHeaders(endpoint.auth_type, authConfig),
    });

    return {
      success: response.ok,
      status: response.status,
      statusText: response.statusText,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
    };
  }
}

// Helper: Build auth headers
function buildAuthHeaders(authType: string, authConfig: any) {
  const headers: Record<string, string> = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };

  switch (authType) {
    case 'api_key':
      headers[authConfig.apiKeyHeader || 'X-API-Key'] = authConfig.apiKey;
      break;
    case 'bearer':
      headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${authConfig.bearerToken}`;
      break;
    case 'custom_header':
      headers[authConfig.customHeader.name] = authConfig.customHeader.value;
      break;
  }

  return headers;
}
```

### Tool Calling Implementation

When a user asks a question, the chat engine:

1. Retrieves relevant knowledge chunks
2. Includes API endpoints as "tools" in the LLM call
3. LLM decides whether to use tools or answer from knowledge
4. If tool called, executes API and feeds result back to LLM

```typescript
// OpenAI function calling format
const tools = endpoints.map(ep => ({
  type: 'function',
  function: {
    name: ep.id, // Use ID as function name
    description: ep.description,
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: extractParamsFromUrl(ep.url), // {order_id: {type: 'string'}}
      required: extractRequiredParams(ep.url),
    },
  },
}));

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [...],
  tools,
  tool_choice: 'auto',
});

// Handle tool calls
if (response.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
  for (const toolCall of response.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
    const endpoint = endpoints.find(ep => ep.id === toolCall.function.name);
    const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);

    // Execute the API call
    const result = await executeEndpoint(endpoint, args);

    // Feed result back to LLM for final response
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Invalid URL format | Show validation error |
| Test fails (timeout) | Show "Connection timeout - check URL" |
| Test fails (4xx) | Show "Auth error - check credentials" |
| Test fails (5xx) | Show "Server error - API may be down" |
| Missing required fields | Show inline validation errors |
| Duplicate endpoint name | Allow (names don't need to be unique) |
| API call fails during chat | Chatbot says "Couldn't retrieve that info, please try again" |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can add API endpoint with all required fields
- [ ] User can test endpoint and see success/failure
- [ ] Auth credentials are stored encrypted
- [ ] User can edit existing endpoints
- [ ] User can delete endpoints
- [ ] Chatbot correctly calls API when relevant to user question
- [ ] Chatbot correctly extracts parameters from user message
- [ ] API results are incorporated into chatbot response

### Widget Dimensions

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Bubble size | 60x60px | 56x56px |
| Chat window width | 380px | 100% (fullscreen) |
| Chat window height | 520px | 100% (fullscreen) |
| Position from edge | 20px | 0 |
| Header height | 56px | 56px |
| Input area height | 60px | 60px |
| Message max width | 80% | 80% |

### Widget Behavior

**Initialization:**
```javascript
// On script load
1. Parse data-project-id from script tag
2. Create Shadow DOM container
3. Inject widget styles into Shadow DOM
4. Render collapsed bubble
5. Generate or retrieve visitor_id from localStorage
6. Retrieve chat history from sessionStorage (if exists)
```

**User Interactions:**
```javascript
// Click bubble
1. Expand to chat window
2. If first open, show welcome message
3. Focus input field

// Send message
1. Add user message to UI
2. Show typing indicator
3. POST to /api/chat
4. Hide typing indicator
5. Add bot response to UI
6. Save to sessionStorage

// Close chat
1. Collapse to bubble
2. Preserve message history

// Page navigation (SPA)
1. Widget persists across route changes
2. Chat history maintained
```

### Technical Implementation

**Widget Entry Point (`widget.js`):**
```javascript
(function() {
  'use strict';

  // Get project ID from script tag
  const script = document.currentScript;
  const projectId = script?.getAttribute('data-project-id');

  if (!projectId) {
    console.error('[YourProduct] Missing data-project-id');
    return;
  }

  // Configuration
  const API_URL = 'https://api.yourproduct.com';
  const VISITOR_ID_KEY = 'yourproduct_visitor_id';
  const CHAT_HISTORY_KEY = 'yourproduct_chat_history';

  // Generate or get visitor ID
  function getVisitorId() {
    let id = localStorage.getItem(VISITOR_ID_KEY);
    if (!id) {
      id = 'vis_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
      localStorage.setItem(VISITOR_ID_KEY, id);
    }
    return id;
  }

  // Create Shadow DOM container
  const container = document.createElement('div');
  container.id = 'yourproduct-widget';
  const shadow = container.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' });
  document.body.appendChild(container);

  // Inject styles
  const styles = `/* Widget CSS here */`;
  const styleEl = document.createElement('style');
  styleEl.textContent = styles;
  shadow.appendChild(styleEl);

  // Widget state
  let isOpen = false;
  let messages = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(CHAT_HISTORY_KEY) || '[]');
  const visitorId = getVisitorId();

  // Render functions
  function render() {
    // Render widget based on state
  }

### System Prompt

```
You are a helpful customer support assistant for {business_name}.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only answer questions using the provided CONTEXT and TOOLS
2. If you don't have enough information to answer, say "I don't have information about that. Please contact our support team at {support_email}."
3. NEVER make up information or hallucinate facts
4. Be concise and helpful
5. If a user asks about their order, account, or real-time data, USE THE AVAILABLE TOOLS

CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:
{retrieved_chunks}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tool_descriptions}

Conversation so far:
{conversation_history}
```

### Vector Search Implementation

```typescript
async function searchKnowledge(
  projectId: string,
  query: string,
  topK: number = 5
): Promise<KnowledgeChunk[]> {
  // 1. Embed the query
  const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
    input: query,
  });

  const queryVector = embedding.data[0].embedding;

  // 2. Search with pgvector
  const { data: chunks } = await supabase.rpc('match_knowledge_chunks', {
    query_embedding: queryVector,
    match_threshold: 0.7,  // Minimum similarity
    match_count: topK,
    p_project_id: projectId,
  });

  return chunks;
}

// SQL function for vector search
/*
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_knowledge_chunks(
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_threshold float,
  match_count int,
  p_project_id uuid
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  content text,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    kc.id,
    kc.content,
    1 - (kc.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM knowledge_chunks kc
  JOIN knowledge_sources ks ON kc.source_id = ks.id
  WHERE ks.project_id = p_project_id
    AND 1 - (kc.embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
  ORDER BY kc.embedding <=> query_embedding
  LIMIT match_count;
END;
$$;
*/
```

### Chat API Implementation

```typescript
// POST /api/chat
interface ChatRequest {
  projectId: string;
  visitorId: string;
  message: string;
  conversationHistory?: Message[];
}

interface ChatResponse {
  message: string;
  conversationId: string;
}

async function handleChat(req: ChatRequest): Promise<ChatResponse> {
  const { projectId, visitorId, message, conversationHistory = [] } = req;

  // 1. Get project config
  const project = await getProject(projectId);
  if (!project) throw new Error('Project not found');

  // 2. Search knowledge base
  const relevantChunks = await searchKnowledge(projectId, message, 5);
  const context = relevantChunks.map(c => c.content).join('\n\n---\n\n');

  // 3. Get API endpoints as tools
  const endpoints = await getApiEndpoints(projectId);
  const tools = endpoints.map(endpointToTool);

  // 4. Build messages array
  const messages = [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: buildSystemPrompt(project, context),
    },
    ...conversationHistory.slice(-10), // Last 10 messages for context
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: message,
    },
  ];

  // 5. Call LLM
  let response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages,
    tools: tools.length > 0 ? tools : undefined,
    tool_choice: tools.length > 0 ? 'auto' : undefined,
  });

  // 6. Handle tool calls
  while (response.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
    const toolCalls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls;

    // Add assistant message with tool calls
    messages.push(response.choices[0].message);

    // Execute each tool call
    for (const toolCall of toolCalls) {
      const endpoint = endpoints.find(e => e.id === toolCall.function.name);
      const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);

      const result = await executeApiEndpoint(endpoint, args);

      messages.push({
        role: 'tool',
        tool_call_id: toolCall.id,
        content: JSON.stringify(result),
      });
    }

    // Get final response
    response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages,
      tools,
      tool_choice: 'auto',
    });
  }

  // 7. Return response
  const assistantMessage = response.choices[0].message.content;

  // 8. Log conversation (async, don't block)
  logConversation(projectId, visitorId, message, assistantMessage);

  return {
    message: assistantMessage,
    conversationId: generateConversationId(),
  };
}
```

### Tool Execution

```typescript
async function executeApiEndpoint(
  endpoint: ApiEndpoint,
  params: Record<string, string>
): Promise<any> {
  // Build URL with params
  let url = endpoint.url;
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(params)) {
    url = url.replace(`{${key}}`, encodeURIComponent(value));
  }

  // Build headers
  const authConfig = await decrypt(endpoint.auth_config);
  const headers = buildAuthHeaders(endpoint.auth_type, authConfig);

  // Make request
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: endpoint.method,
      headers,
      body: endpoint.method === 'POST' ? JSON.stringify(params) : undefined,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      return { error: `API returned ${response.status}` };
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    return { error: 'Failed to fetch data' };
  }
}
```

### Response Handling

**When knowledge is sufficient:**
```
User: "What's your return policy?"
Bot: "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase. Items must be unused and in original packaging. To initiate a return, please email returns@store.com with your order number."
```

**When tool call is needed:**
```
User: "Where's my order #12345?"
[Bot calls Order Status API with order_id: "12345"]
[API returns: {status: "out_for_delivery", eta: "today by 5pm"}]
Bot: "Your order #12345 is out for delivery and should arrive today by 5pm!"
```

**When no information available:**
```
User: "Do you sell purple widgets?"
Bot: "I don't have information about that specific product. Please contact our support team at support@store.com or check our website for the full product catalog."
```

### Rate Limiting

```typescript
const RATE_LIMITS = {
  messagesPerMinute: 10,
  messagesPerHour: 50,
  messagesPerDay: 200,
};

async function checkRateLimit(visitorId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const key = `rate_limit:${visitorId}`;

```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No relevant chunks found | LLM responds based on general instructions |
| Tool call fails | Include error in tool response, LLM apologizes |
| Multiple tool calls needed | Execute sequentially, feed all results back |
| Very long user message | Truncate to 2000 chars |
| Rate limit exceeded | Return "Please wait before sending more messages" |
| LLM returns empty response | Return fallback "I'm having trouble responding" |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chat engine receives messages and returns responses
- [ ] Responses are based on uploaded knowledge
- [ ] API tools are called when appropriate
- [ ] Tool results are incorporated into responses
- [ ] "I don't know" responses are graceful, not hallucinated
- [ ] Conversation context is maintained
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Response time is under 5 seconds for most queries

    }
  ]
}
```

### MCP Server Implementation

```typescript
// mcp-server/index.ts
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

const server = new Server(
  {
    name: 'yourproduct-chatbot',
    version: '1.0.0',
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      tools: {},
    },
  }
);

// List available tools
server.setRequestHandler('tools/list', async () => {
  return {
    tools: [
      {
        name: 'create_project',
        description: 'Create a new chatbot project...',
        inputSchema: { /* ... */ },
      },
      {
        name: 'upload_knowledge',
        description: 'Add knowledge content...',
        inputSchema: { /* ... */ },
      },
      // ... other tools
    ],
  };
});

// Handle tool calls
server.setRequestHandler('tools/call', async (request) => {
  const { name, arguments: args } = request.params;

  switch (name) {
    case 'create_project':
      return await handleCreateProject(args);
    case 'upload_knowledge':
      return await handleUploadKnowledge(args);
    case 'add_api_endpoint':
      return await handleAddApiEndpoint(args);
    case 'get_embed_code':
      return await handleGetEmbedCode(args);
    case 'list_projects':
      return await handleListProjects(args);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${name}`);
  }
});

// Start server
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Authentication

**Option 1: API Key**
```bash
# User generates API key from dashboard
# Configures MCP server with key

# In MCP server config
{
  "yourproduct": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["yourproduct-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "YOURPRODUCT_API_KEY": "sk_live_xxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: OAuth (for hosted MCP)**
```typescript
// MCP server handles OAuth flow
// Stores refresh token securely
// Auto-refreshes access token
```

### Example Vibe Coding Session

**User prompt to Lovable:**
> "Add a customer support chatbot to my e-commerce site. It should answer questions about products using the product info from my database, and let customers check their order status using the API at https://api.mystore.com/orders/{order_id} with bearer token 'xyz123'."

**Lovable (via MCP) executes:**
```
1. create_project(name: "E-commerce Support")
   → Returns: proj_abc123

2. upload_knowledge(
     project_id: "proj_abc123",
     name: "Product Info",
     content: [extracts product info from database]
   )
   → Returns: 15 chunks created

3. add_api_endpoint(
     project_id: "proj_abc123",
     name: "Order Status",
     description: "Get order status and tracking. Use when customer asks about their order.",
     url: "https://api.mystore.com/orders/{order_id}",
     method: "GET",
     auth_type: "bearer",
     auth_value: "xyz123"
   )
   → Returns: endpoint created

4. get_embed_code(project_id: "proj_abc123")
   → Returns: <script src="..."></script>

5. [Lovable adds script to index.html]
```

**Result:** Working chatbot on the site in ~30 seconds.

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Return auth error with instructions |
| Project not found | Return clear error message |
| Knowledge upload fails | Return error, allow retry |
| Rate limit exceeded | Return rate limit error with reset time |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server implements all 5 core tools
- [ ] Authentication works via API key
- [ ] Tools can be called from Lovable/Cursor
- [ ] create_project creates functional project
- [ ] upload_knowledge processes and indexes content
- [ ] add_api_endpoint configures working tool
- [ ] get_embed_code returns valid script tag
- [ ] Error handling is clear and actionable

## 13.4 Widget Design

```css
/* Chat bubble */
.widget-bubble {
  width: 60px;
  height: 60px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #0a0a0a;
  color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

/* Chat window */
.widget-window {
  width: 380px;
  height: 520px;
  border-radius: 16px;
  background: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

/* Message bubbles */
.message.user {
  background: #0a0a0a;
  color: #ffffff;
  border-radius: 18px 18px 4px 18px;
}

.message.bot {
  background: #f4f4f5;
  color: #0a0a0a;
  border-radius: 18px 18px 18px 4px;
}
```

# 14. Security Considerations

## 14.1 Authentication Security
- Magic links expire after 1 hour
- Rate limit: 5 magic link requests per email per hour
- Sessions use Supabase JWT with refresh tokens
- API keys are hashed before storage (show only once)

## 14.2 Data Security
- API endpoint credentials encrypted at rest
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- File uploads scanned for malware (if implementing)

## 14.3 API Security
- Chat API rate limited per visitor
- API key authentication for MCP
- CORS configured for widget domain
- Input validation on all endpoints

## 14.4 Widget Security
- Shadow DOM prevents CSS injection
- No sensitive data stored in widget
- Project ID is public but rate limited
- XSS prevention in message rendering

## 14.5 Third-party API Calls
- Credentials never exposed to frontend
- API calls made from backend only
- Timeout limits on external calls
- Error responses don't leak credentials
